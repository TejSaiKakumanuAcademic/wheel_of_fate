```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Test Before Deploying
```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Preview locally on http://localhost:4173
npm run preview
```

## What Gets Deployed?

After running `npm run build`, you'll get a `dist` folder containing:
- Optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Compressed assets
- All your app files ready for production

**Important**: The `dist` folder is what you deploy to hosting services.

## Environment Considerations

### Data Persistence
- Currently uses `localStorage` for data storage
- Data is stored locally in the user's browser
- If you need cloud sync across devices, you would need to add a backend (Firebase, Supabase, etc.)

### No Backend Required
- This is a fully static app
- No server-side code needed
- Works perfectly on static hosting platforms
